#### Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt
It is important to note that you must be able to initialize the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt environment for `x86_x64`. The Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt should already be downloaded if you have Microsoft Visual Studio installed. 

To check if you are able to intialize the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt for `x86_x64`, you can open the start menu and search for `x86_x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022`. If this program exists, then you may continue to the next steps.

Alternatively, you can check to see if the following filepath exists: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat` (with Visual Studio 2022 installed). If the filepath exists, then you may continue to the next steps.
